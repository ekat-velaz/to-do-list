# to-do-list

ðŸ”— GitHub pages link: https://ekat-velaz.github.io/to-do-list/

A small to-do-list website and app that stores the information in the local storage of your computer! 
You can add your own projects, store tasks in them, delete and edit project's name and task's name, date and description. Also the app is updating today's and this week's tasks for you, so it's easier to track the due date of tasks.

What did I practice with this project:
- how to use date-fns library;
- how to use localStorage and JSON;
- tried to use SOLID principles.
